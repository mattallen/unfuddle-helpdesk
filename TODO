- provide a way for people to submit comments for a ticket


Maybe no:

- show the age of the oldest unassigned ticket (in relative time) on the front page

DONE

- display dates in "4 days ago" style

- unassigned tickets that are still within the 24 hour period should be a neutral color (grey?)
- only the unassigned tickets that are outside the 24 hour timeframe should be red

- try to use the real unfuddle reporter if there is no '--reported-->' string in the summary

- clean up the view for submitting tickets
 - need to allow select box for business area (component)
 - use cookies to remember name and component
 - use cookies for the flash[:notice] business
